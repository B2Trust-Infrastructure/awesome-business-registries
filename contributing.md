# Contributing to Awesome Business Registries

Thank you for contributing! This list aims to be the most comprehensive, developer-focused reference for official government business registry APIs worldwide.

## What belongs here

- **Official government APIs** — the primary source of company data for a jurisdiction
- **Well-established community projects** built directly on official data (e.g., OffeneRegister.de, BrasilAPI)
- **Cross-border tools** that aggregate from official sources

## What doesn't belong here

- Commercial data aggregators or resellers (unless they're the only way to access a country's data)
- APIs that scrape unofficial sources
- Deprecated or permanently offline endpoints

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your entry in the appropriate regional section
3. Follow the existing format — include at minimum:
   - Country and registry name
   - API endpoint URL
   - Auth type (use the legend symbols: 🟢 🔑 🔐 💰)
   - Data format (REST/JSON, SOAP/XML, HTML, etc.)
   - Any known rate limits
   - Whether bulk data is available (📦)
   - Developer-relevant notes (gotchas, quirks, tips)
4. Submit a pull request with a brief description of what you added

## Format guidelines

- Keep entries factual and concise — developer notes, not marketing copy
- If an API has undocumented quirks you've discovered through implementation, those are especially valuable
- Include the national ID format (e.g., "KRS: 10 digits", "ABN: 11 digits") — this helps with ID detection
- If you've measured average response times, include them
- Note any authentication gotchas (e.g., UK Companies House requires a trailing colon in basic auth)

## Updating existing entries

APIs change. If you find an endpoint has moved, auth requirements have changed, or rate limits have been updated, please submit a PR with the correction. Include a brief note about when you last verified the information.

## Questions?

Open an issue if you're unsure whether a source fits, or if you have information but aren't sure how to format it.
